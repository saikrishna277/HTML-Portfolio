<h1>About Me</h1>

With a strong foundation in programming languages like C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic Python, I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships and projects such as developing an Online Bike Rental System. I'm proficient with tools like VS Code, GitHub, and Linux, and have a solid understanding of core technical subjects including Operating Systems, DBMS, and Computer Networks. I continuously strive to grow my skill set, as reflected in certifications from NPTEL and Infosys Wingspan, and I enjoy applying my knowledge to real-world web development tasks. Outside of academics, I’m an avid cricket enthusiast and love traveling.</p>
